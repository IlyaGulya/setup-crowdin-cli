# Progress: Setup Crowdin CLI GitHub Action

## What Works

- Project repository created
- Basic directory structure set up
- Documentation created
- Setup action implemented
- Dependencies updated
- GitHub workflow simplified
- Repository information hardcoded for simplicity
- Octokit integration for GitHub API interactions
- GitHub Script used for version checking
- JSDoc comments added to improve code documentation
- Version requirement added to support only Crowdin CLI 4.4.0 and above
- Action updated to download binaries from the standalone repository
- Version checking logic simplified
- "executable-" prefix handling removed

## What's Left to Build

1. **Setup Action**
   - [x] Create action metadata file
   - [x] Implement download logic
   - [x] Implement caching logic
   - [x] Add platform detection
   - [x] Make CLI available in PATH
   - [x] Update to use Octokit for API interactions
   - [x] Add JSDoc comments for better documentation
   - [x] Add version requirement for Crowdin CLI 4.4.0 and above
   - [x] Update to download binaries from the standalone repository
   - [x] Remove "executable-" prefix handling
   - [ ] Test the action with the standalone repository
   - [ ] Verify that caching works as expected
   - [ ] Test on different platforms

2. **Documentation**
   - [x] Create comprehensive README
   - [x] Add usage examples
   - [x] Document configuration options
   - [ ] Update to reflect the latest changes
   - [ ] Update usage examples with the latest approach

## Current Status

The project has been significantly simplified. The setup action now focuses solely on downloading and setting up the Crowdin CLI from the standalone repository.

Key improvements include:
- Using Octokit for GitHub API interactions
- Simplifying the version checking logic
- Removing the "executable-" prefix handling
- Adding JSDoc comments to improve code documentation
- Enforcing minimum version requirement of Crowdin CLI 4.4.0

The next steps are to test the updated action to ensure it works as expected, and to update the documentation to reflect the changes.

## Known Issues

- The updated action has not been fully tested yet
- Documentation needs to be updated to reflect the latest changes
