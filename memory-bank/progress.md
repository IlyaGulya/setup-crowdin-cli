# Progress: Setup Crowdin CLI GitHub Action

## What Works

- Project repository created
- Basic directory structure set up
- Documentation created
- Periodic build workflow implemented and improved
- Setup action implemented and fixed
- Test workflow created
- Dependencies updated
- Action built successfully with @vercel/ncc
- Matrix-based build strategy implemented
- Tag-based triggers for manual version releases added
- Artifact handling between jobs improved
- Concurrency control added to prevent workflow conflicts
- **Workflow optimized to download JAR directly in build jobs**
- **Agent-based native-image configuration replaced with custom reflection feature**
- **Testing of built binaries integrated directly into the build job**
- **Testing simplified by using environment variables instead of modifying config files**

   - [x] **Implement custom reflection feature for native image building**
   - [x] **Integrate testing of built binaries directly into the build job**
   - [x] **Simplify testing by using environment variables**

2. **Setup Action**
   - [x] Create action metadata file
   - [x] Implement download logic
   - [x] Implement caching logic
   - [x] Add platform detection
   - [x] Make CLI available in PATH
   - [x] Fix to download custom-built executables
   - [x] Build action with @vercel/ncc

3. **Documentation**
   - [x] Create comprehensive README

   - [ ] **Document the custom reflection feature and its benefits**

4. **Testing**
   - [ ] Test workflow with different versions
   - [ ] Test action on different platforms
   - [ ] Verify caching works as expected
   - [ ] Test the matrix-based build strategy
   - [ ] **Test the optimized JAR download process**
   - [ ] **Test the custom reflection feature with different Crowdin CLI versions**
   - [x] **Implement integrated testing of binaries in the build workflow**
   - [x] **Optimize testing by using environment variables**

## Current Status

Project implementation is complete, fixed, and improved. The action has been successfully compiled into a single file using @vercel/ncc. The build workflow has been enhanced with a matrix-based build strategy, tag-based triggers, improved artifact handling, and concurrency control. **The workflow has been further optimized by downloading the JAR directly in each build job, eliminating the need for a separate download job and reducing overhead. Additionally, the agent-based native-image configuration has been replaced with a custom reflection feature, providing more control over the build process and resulting in more optimized executables. Testing of the built binaries has been integrated directly into the build job, ensuring that each binary is tested on its native platform immediately after being built. The testing process has been simplified by using environment variables instead of modifying configuration files, making the workflow more maintainable and robust.** The next steps are to test the action and workflow to ensure they work as expected and to update the documentation to reflect the latest improvements.

## Known Issues

- The action has not been tested yet
- The workflow has not been tested yet
- The action might need adjustments based on testing results
- Documentation needs to be updated to reflect the latest workflow improvements
