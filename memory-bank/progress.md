# Progress: Setup Crowdin CLI GitHub Action

## What Works

- Project repository created
- Basic directory structure set up
- Documentation created
- GitHub workflow for building and releasing Crowdin CLI binaries implemented
- Setup action implemented
- Dependencies updated
- GitHub workflow simplified to focus on direct GitHub releases
- Repository information hardcoded for simplicity
- Octokit integration for GitHub API interactions
- GitHub Script used for version checking
- `softprops/action-gh-release` used for creating GitHub releases
- JSDoc comments added to improve code documentation

## What's Left to Build

1. **GitHub Workflow**
   - [x] Create workflow file
   - [x] Implement version checking logic
   - [x] Set up GraalVM build environment
   - [x] Implement native executable building
   - [x] Create GitHub releases
   - [x] Simplify to focus on direct GitHub releases
   - [x] Update version checking to use Octokit
   - [x] Implement release creation using `softprops/action-gh-release`
   - [ ] Test the workflow with different versions
   - [ ] Verify that version checking works correctly
   - [ ] Test the release creation process

2. **Setup Action**
   - [x] Create action metadata file
   - [x] Implement download logic
   - [x] Implement caching logic
   - [x] Add platform detection
   - [x] Make CLI available in PATH
   - [x] Update to use Octokit for API interactions
   - [x] Add JSDoc comments for better documentation
   - [ ] Test the action with different versions
   - [ ] Verify that caching works as expected
   - [ ] Test on different platforms

3. **Documentation**
   - [x] Create comprehensive README
   - [x] Add usage examples
   - [x] Document configuration options
   - [ ] Update to reflect the new workflow process
   - [ ] Document the GitHub release strategy
   - [ ] Update usage examples with the latest approach
   - [ ] Document the JSDoc comments and their benefits

## Current Status

The project has been significantly simplified and improved. We've rewritten the GitHub workflow to publish releases directly to GitHub instead of using a Docker container registry. The codebase now focuses solely on the user's repository (ilyagulya/setup-crowdin-cli) instead of supporting multiple repositories.

Key improvements include:
- Using Octokit for GitHub API interactions, replacing direct fetch calls
- Using GitHub Script for workflow operations to simplify the workflow
- Using `softprops/action-gh-release` for creating GitHub releases
- Adding JSDoc comments to improve code documentation and type hinting
- Hardcoding repository information for simplicity and clarity
- Enhancing error handling throughout the codebase

The workflow now follows a straightforward process:
1. Check for new Crowdin CLI versions
2. Build native executables if a new version is detected
3. Create an orphan branch for each version
4. Create a `.crowdin-version` file with the version number
5. Commit and tag changes
6. Download artifacts and publish releases to GitHub

The next steps are to test the updated workflow and action to ensure they work as expected, and to update the documentation to reflect the latest improvements.

## Known Issues

- The updated workflow has not been fully tested yet
- The action with Octokit integration needs testing
- Documentation needs to be updated to reflect the latest workflow improvements
- Error handling might need further enhancement based on testing results
