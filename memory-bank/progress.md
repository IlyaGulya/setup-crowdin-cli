# Progress: Setup Crowdin CLI GitHub Action

## What Works

- Project repository created
- Basic directory structure set up
- Documentation created
- Periodic build workflow implemented and improved
- Setup action implemented and fixed
- Test workflow created
- Dependencies updated
- Action built successfully with @vercel/ncc
- Matrix-based build strategy implemented
- Tag-based triggers for manual version releases added
- Artifact handling between jobs improved
- Concurrency control added to prevent workflow conflicts
- **Workflow optimized to download JAR directly in build jobs**
- **Agent-based native-image configuration replaced with custom reflection feature**

## What's Left to Build

1. **Periodic Build Workflow**
   - [x] Create workflow file
   - [x] Implement version checking logic
   - [x] Set up GraalVM build environment
   - [x] Implement native executable building
   - [x] Create GitHub releases
   - [x] Implement matrix-based build strategy
   - [x] Add tag-based triggers for manual version releases
   - [x] Improve artifact handling between jobs
   - [x] Add concurrency control
   - [x] **Optimize JAR download process**
   - [x] **Implement custom reflection feature for native image building**

2. **Setup Action**
   - [x] Create action metadata file
   - [x] Implement download logic
   - [x] Implement caching logic
   - [x] Add platform detection
   - [x] Make CLI available in PATH
   - [x] Fix to download custom-built executables
   - [x] Build action with @vercel/ncc

3. **Documentation**
   - [x] Create comprehensive README
   - [x] Add usage examples
   - [x] Document configuration options
   - [x] Update to clarify custom-built executables
   - [ ] Document the new workflow improvements
   - [ ] **Document the optimized build process**
   - [ ] **Document the custom reflection feature and its benefits**

4. **Testing**
   - [ ] Test workflow with different versions
   - [ ] Test action on different platforms
   - [ ] Verify caching works as expected
   - [ ] Test the matrix-based build strategy
   - [ ] **Test the optimized JAR download process**
   - [ ] **Test the custom reflection feature with different Crowdin CLI versions**

## Current Status

Project implementation is complete, fixed, and improved. The action has been successfully compiled into a single file using @vercel/ncc. The build workflow has been enhanced with a matrix-based build strategy, tag-based triggers, improved artifact handling, and concurrency control. **The workflow has been further optimized by downloading the JAR directly in each build job, eliminating the need for a separate download job and reducing overhead. Additionally, the agent-based native-image configuration has been replaced with a custom reflection feature, providing more control over the build process and resulting in more optimized executables.** The next steps are to test the action and workflow to ensure they work as expected and to update the documentation to reflect the latest improvements.

## Known Issues

- The action has not been tested yet
- The workflow has not been tested yet
- The action might need adjustments based on testing results
- Documentation needs to be updated to reflect the latest workflow improvements
