# Active Context: Setup Crowdin CLI GitHub Action

## Current Work Focus

We are currently focused on simplifying and improving the GitHub Actions workflow for the Crowdin CLI setup action:

1. **GitHub Workflow Simplification**
   - Rewriting the workflow to publish releases directly to GitHub instead of using Docker container registry
   - Simplifying the codebase to focus solely on the user's repository (ilyagulya/setup-crowdin-cli)
   - Implementing a more straightforward version checking mechanism
   - Using GitHub Script with Octokit for GitHub API interactions
   - Using `softprops/action-gh-release` for creating GitHub releases

2. **Code Improvements**
   - Adding JSDoc comments to improve code documentation and type hinting
   - Replacing direct fetch calls with Octokit API methods
   - Hardcoding repository information for simplicity and clarity
   - Enhancing error handling throughout the codebase

3. **Workflow Process Refinement**
   - Creating an orphan branch for each version
   - Creating a `.crowdin-version` file with the version number
   - Committing and tagging changes
   - Downloading artifacts and publishing releases to GitHub

## Recent Changes

- Rewrote the `build-and-release.yml` workflow to publish releases directly to GitHub
- Simplified the codebase to focus solely on the user's repository
- Added environment variables for repository owner and name
- Updated the version checking logic to use hardcoded repository values
- Replaced fetch calls with Octokit API methods in `src/index.js`
- Enhanced error handling for API calls
- Updated the `check-for-updates` job to use GitHub Script with Octokit
- Reverted from using Octokit for release creation to using `softprops/action-gh-release`
- Added JSDoc comments to `src/index.js` to improve code documentation and type hinting

## Next Steps

1. Test the updated workflow
   - Test the GitHub release creation process
   - Verify that version checking works correctly
   - Test the binary download and setup process

2. Update documentation
   - Document the new workflow process
   - Update usage examples
   - Clarify the release process

3. Consider additional improvements
   - Further enhance error handling
   - Add more comprehensive logging
   - Consider additional platform support if needed

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **GitHub Release Strategy**
   - Using GitHub releases instead of Docker container registry for simplicity
   - Creating an orphan branch for each version to maintain a clean history
   - Using tags for versioning and release identification

2. **API Interaction Approach**
   - Using Octokit for GitHub API interactions for better type safety and error handling
   - Using GitHub Script for workflow operations to simplify the workflow
   - Using `softprops/action-gh-release` for creating releases as it's simpler and more reliable

3. **Code Documentation**
   - Adding JSDoc comments to improve code documentation and type hinting
   - Ensuring clear error messages and logging
   - Maintaining code clarity and readability

4. **Repository Simplification**
   - Focusing solely on the user's repository instead of supporting multiple repositories
   - Hardcoding repository information for simplicity and clarity
   - Streamlining the workflow to reduce complexity
