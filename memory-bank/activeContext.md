# Active Context: Setup Crowdin CLI GitHub Action

## Current Work Focus

We have implemented, fixed, and improved the two main components:

1. **Periodic Build Workflow**
   - A GitHub workflow that checks for new Crowdin CLI versions
   - Builds native executables using GraalVM
   - Creates GitHub releases with these executables
   - Now uses a matrix strategy for building on different platforms
   - Supports tag-based triggers for manual version releases
   - **Optimized to download JAR directly in build jobs**

2. **Setup Action**
   - A GitHub Action that downloads the requested version of our custom-built Crowdin CLI
   - Stores it in the GitHub runner's tool cache
   - Makes it available for use in workflows
   - Successfully compiled into a single file using @vercel/ncc

## Recent Changes

- Created the project repository
- Set up the basic directory structure
- Documented the project requirements and architecture
- Implemented the periodic build workflow
- Implemented the setup action
- Created a test workflow
- Updated documentation
- Fixed the action to download our custom-built executables instead of official ones
- Updated dependencies and GitHub Actions versions
- Built the action using @vercel/ncc to create a single distributable file
- **Improved the build workflow with matrix strategy for better maintainability**
- **Added tag-based triggers for manual version releases**
- **Improved artifact handling between jobs**
- **Added concurrency control to prevent workflow conflicts**
- **Optimized the workflow by downloading JAR directly in build jobs**
- **Replaced agent-based native-image configuration with custom reflection feature**
- **Added testing of built binaries directly in the build job**
- **Simplified testing by using environment variables instead of modifying config files**

## Next Steps

1. Test both components
   - Test the workflow with different Crowdin CLI versions
   - Test the action on different platforms
   - Verify that caching works as expected
   - Test the new matrix-based build strategy
   - **Test the optimized JAR download process**
   - **Test the custom reflection feature for native image building**
   - **Verify that the integrated testing of binaries works correctly**

2. Make adjustments based on testing results
   - Fix any issues found during testing
   - Improve error handling
   - Optimize performance

3. Publish the action
   - Create a release
   - Publish to the GitHub Marketplace
   - Announce the availability

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Testing Strategy**
   - How to effectively test the action and workflow
   - Which versions of Crowdin CLI to test with
   - How to verify that caching works as expected
   - How to test the matrix-based build strategy
   - **How to verify the optimized JAR download process**
   - **How to ensure the integrated testing of binaries is reliable across platforms**
   - **How to handle potential test failures in different environments**

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - How to handle network issues
   - How to handle version mismatches
   - How to provide meaningful error messages
   - How to handle failures in specific matrix jobs

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - How to optimize the download and caching process
   - How to minimize the action execution time
   - How to parallelize builds efficiently
   - **How to further optimize the workflow if needed**
   - **How to fine-tune the custom reflection configuration for optimal results**

4. **Documentation Improvements**
   - How to make the documentation more user-friendly
   - What additional examples to provide
   - How to document troubleshooting steps
   - How to document the new workflow improvements
   - **How to document the optimized build process**
   - **How to document the custom reflection feature and its benefits**
